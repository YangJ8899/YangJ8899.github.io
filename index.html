                        <p>ShoppingQ was a web application for the Def Hacks Virtual 2020 hackathon. The main premise was to create a user friendly web app that could be useful for the covid-19 pandemic. Me and my classmates decided to create an application that allows stores to enter how many people are waiting in line, and will calculate the average wait time to enter the store. My role was to create a security system for the store owners with SQL and PHP. Things like signing up, logging in, and resetting a password. I also worked on creating a secure database to store all the information that would be inputted into the application.</p>

                        <p>This is my first go at creating a personal website. It was created using a combination of my HTML and CSS skills from beforehand, as well me trying to self learn some Javascript to help make the site responsive, and aesthetically pleasing. Most of the animations you see on the site are from javascript and all the formatting and links and such are all from HTML and CSS. This website is a way to show myself in a relaxed and easy to follow format. It will be updated regularily if something new comes up in my life that is of significance.</p>

                        <p> Space Virus Defense was a my first step into the world of programming. It was a my take at a mix of space invaders and tower defense games put into one... except you are trying to protect PCs from viruses, and those PCs are stuck in outer space. It was created using python and the pygame interface, looking back at it now, there are alot of things that could be improved, but considering it was my first ever project, I think it went quite well.</p>

                        <p>During the covid-19 pandemic, I decided it was time to learn some new skills, and one of the main things I wanted to learn was React and Node. This is a quick and simple real time chat application created with the use of React and Node, as well as implementing some express and socket.io for the back-end. It allows for users to input a name and a chat room they want to join and chat with people from anywhere as long as the room names are the same. It was a good project for me to start off with as it helped me grasp an understanding of how react and node works. You can try out the site by clicking the link below and follow the readme file on github.</p>
